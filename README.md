This is a simple prject I made to help me practice the basics of webdevelopment. 

Features: 
You click on the continents and colors checkboxes, then the flags of countries that exists in the chosen continents and whose flag colors include the chosen flags will be displayed on screen.
When you hover over the generated flags, the name of the country is displayed.
