4. The flags would be displayed in a grid 

METHOD
1. Save all the chosen colours into an array 
2. Save all the chosen continents into an array 
3. Narrow down the countries objects to remain those that are in the chosen continents 
4. Two ways of choosing the countries: 

    - Method 1: Pick the first colour in the colour array and check if the countries in the continents have the colour. 
        Narrow down the countries objects further to include the countries that have the colour of the flag. 
        Do the same for the second colour, check the second colour and check if the countries objects has that colour also. 
        If they do than narrow the countries objects further to the countries objects that include two out of the three chosen colours.
        Check for the last chosen colour. Check if the countries objects include the last colour.
        If they do, then print out the flags. 
        If they don't then log "No Country Flag has the colour combination. TRY AGAIN!"  

    
    - Method 2: Make a list of the chosen colours, then look for the object in the countries objects that include all the selected colours - be it one, two or three colours 
        that are selected.
        Then narrow down the countries objects to only those countries whose flags include the three selected colours.
